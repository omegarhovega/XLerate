4. To quickly close the dialog window hit `Esc`

### Consistency Checker

2. Review highlighted inconsistencies in the selection (red) and check which formulas are consistent (green)
3. Click "Horizontal Consistency" again to remove the formatting   

### Number, Cell, Date and Text Formatting Cycles
1. Select a cell or range of cells
2. Click "Format" in the XLerate ribbon under Formatting and select one of the options repeatedly to cycle through the different preset formats
3. For faster access, the number, cell and date cycles can be accessed via shortcuts: Pressing `Ctrl + Shift + 1` repeatedly cycles through set number formats, `+ 2` through cell formats, `+ 3` through date formats, and `+ 4` through text formats
4. Click on the "Settings" button in ribbon and then on "Numbers", "Dates", "Cells" or "Text Styles" to access the predifined styles and to add your own styles to the cycles, or to remove or modify existing ones

### Auto-coloring of Numbers 
1. Select a cell or range of cells
2. Click "Auto-color Numbers" in the XLerate ribbon under Formatting
3. The function applies different font colors to inputs, (partial) formulas, worksheet and workbook links, external links, and hyperlinks within the selection
4. Click on the "Settings" button in ribbon and then on "Auto-Color" to access the predifined colors, modify existing ones or reset them to defaults

### Smart Fill Right
1. Select a cell containing a formula which has a range of values in any of the 3 rows above it
2. Click "Smart Fill Right" in the XLerate ribbon under Formulas to apply the smart fill function
3. For faster access, use the `Ctrl + Shift + R` shortcut
4. The smart fill function applies if there is a pattern of values within 1-3 rows above the reference cell

### Error Wrapping
1. Select a cell or range of cells
2. Click "Error Wrap" in the XLerate ribbon under Formatting to add an IFERROR statement to any formulas within your selection
3. If one of the selected cells does not contain a formula and is not affected a pop-up window will alert you to this
4. Click on the "Settings" button in ribbon and then on "Error" to access or modify the predifined error value displayed

### Switch Sings
1. Select a cell or range of cells
2. Click "Switch Sign" in the XLerate ribbon under Formulas to change the sign of a cell or formula from positive to negative or vice versa

### CAGR Function
1. Type `+CAGR` and select a range of cells with numbers
2. The formula will calculate an annual CAGR based on the first and last number in the selection and the number of values (years)

We **highly recommend** adding individual functions you use often to Excel's quick access toolbar (Excel ‚Üí File ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Quick Access Toolbar). In the "Chose commands from:", dropdown select "XLerate Tab" and add any function as needed.

**NOTE:** The above functions mainly rely on Excel macros and, as part of Excel's design, executing a macro empties the user's Undo chain. This means that after executing a function your Undo steps will be reset (`Ctrl+Z` will have no effect right after executing a macro and the Undo chain starts again). Therefore, save your work frequently (the best standard procedure for financial analysis in Excel) to retain your ability to step back to an earlier version if need be at any time.
